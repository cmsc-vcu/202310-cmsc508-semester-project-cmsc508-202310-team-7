# Entity Relationship Diagrams
Often one of the first steps in database design, Entity Relationship (ER) Diagrams are a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a database system.

## Draft History
* Draft 1: First attemot at making an ER diagram
* Draft 2: Improved drawing and structure of draft 1
* Draft 2b: Represents the initial concept of making a larger relationship
* Draft 3: Brainstorm to rework the ERD to include the new larger relationship
* Final: After conversations with the professor we reworked all large relationships to binary relationships through restructuring and decompositon
